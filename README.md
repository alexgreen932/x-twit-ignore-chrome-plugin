# 🧹 Simple X (Twitter) Chrome Extension – Hide Tweets by Keywords

Ever find yourself thinking:  
**"I can't stand seeing this kind of news on my feed today"?**

This lightweight Chrome extension helps you clean up your X (formerly Twitter) timeline by **automatically hiding tweets containing specific keywords**.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Automatically detects and removes tweets that match your keywords
- 🧠 Easy-to-use popup to add or remove keywords
- 💾 Keywords are saved in local storage — even after you close the browser
- 📊 Tracks how many tweets were filtered each day (coming soon!)

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Install the extension**
   - Load it as an unpacked extension in `chrome://extensions`
   - Make sure "Developer Mode" is turned on
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder

2. **Open X.com (Twitter)** and the extension popup

3. **Add keywords** like `politics`, `spoilers`, or anything else you don’t want to see

4. The extension will start hiding matching tweets from your timeline in real time

---

## 📌 Notes

- The extension works on both `x.com` and `twitter.com` domains
- All filtering happens on your device — nothing is sent anywhere
- New tweets loaded as you scroll are filtered automatically

---

## 💡 Coming Soon

- Stats view to see how many tweets were filtered each day
- Optional keyword syncing across devices
- Smart filtering (e.g., only filter unverified tweets)
